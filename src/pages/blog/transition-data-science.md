# Why I Want to Transition to a Career in Data Science

Hello, everyone! My name is <YOUR NAME> and I am a frontend developer with 9 years of experience. In this blog post, I want to share with you why I decided to pursue a career change and become a data scientist.

## My Journey as a Frontend Developer

I started my career as a frontend developer at the Geospatial Innovation Facility (GIF) at UC Berkeley, where I worked on various projects related to climate change adaptation and resilience. One of the main projects I was involved in was Cal-Adapt, a web platform that provides access to peer-reviewed climate data and tools for California.

As a frontend developer, I was responsible for designing and developing user interfaces, interactive visualizations, and web applications using various technologies such as Bootstrap, Svelte, IBM's Carbon Design System, and Jupyter notebooks. I also led user interface design reviews, contributed to API documentation, and coordinated deliverables with the team and the clients.

Some of the highlights of my work at Cal-Adapt include:

- Creating climate tools that allow users to explore and analyze downscaled CMIP5 climate data for different scenarios, variables, and regions in California.
- Updating Cal-Adapt's legacy code to a new technology stack that improved performance, accessibility, and user experience.
- Designing and developing the front-end interface for the Adaptation Clearinghouse, a repository of resources and case studies on climate adaptation best practices.
- Converting printed adaptation guides to interactive web content that engages and educates users on various topics such as sea level rise, extreme heat, and wildfire.

## My Previous Experience as a GIS and Data Analyst

Before working as a frontend developer, I also worked as a GIS and Data Analyst at various environmental consulting firms. In that role, I worked on the following:

- Spatial data analysis and cartography: Conducted comprehensive geospatial analysis, including spatial data collection, mapping, and database management, to support natural resource management and environmental compliance projects.
- Query, extract and process data in SQL Server: Transformed datasets received from labs and historical sources into formats compatible with Floyd|Sniders’ proprietary environmental chemistry database. Extracted the data into reports for use by other team members.
- Automate workflows using VBA: Developed tailored solutions for exporting mapbooks from ESRI ArcGIS, programmed Microsoft Excel macros for modeling streamflow and fish habitat.

This experience gave me a solid foundation in working with various types of data, such as spatial, temporal, and chemical, and applying analytical and programming skills to solve problems and optimize workflows.

## My Interest in Data Science

While working as a frontend developer, I developed a strong interest in data science, especially in the fields of climate science and environmental sustainability. I realized that data science is not only about creating beautiful and functional web interfaces, but also about finding meaningful insights and solutions from complex and large datasets.

Some of the reasons why I became interested in data science are:

- I enjoyed prototyping visualizations for climate data using Jupyter and Observable notebooks, and I wanted to learn more about the data analysis and modeling techniques behind them.
- I was fascinated by the climate science topics that I researched for building climate tools, such as extreme value analysis and sea level rise projections, and I wanted to deepen my understanding of the scientific methods and concepts involved.
- I was motivated by the impact and relevance of data science for addressing real-world problems and challenges, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and I wanted to contribute to finding data-driven solutions for a more sustainable future.

## My Plan for Transitioning to Data Science

To pursue my passion for data science, I decided to enroll in a Data Science Bootcamp that offers a comprehensive curriculum covering topics such as Python programming, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, and data visualization.

The bootcamp also provides hands-on projects, mentorship, and career support to help me build a portfolio and land a job as a data scientist. I am currently halfway through the bootcamp and I am learning a lot of new and exciting skills and tools every day.

Some of the projects that I have completed or are working on include:

- Analyzing and visualizing Airbnb listings data for San Francisco using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- Building a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn or not using scikit-learn, logistic regression, and random forest.
- Creating a chatbot that can answer questions about climate change using spaCy, nltk, and transformers.
- Developing a web app that can generate captions for images using Flask, TensorFlow, and a pre-trained CNN-LSTM model.

## My Goals and Aspirations as a Data Scientist

My goal is to become a data scientist who can apply my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems and create positive social and environmental impact. I am particularly interested in working on projects that involve climate change, renewable energy, biodiversity, and conservation.

Some of the aspirations that I have as a data scientist are:

- To work with organizations that share my values and vision for a more sustainable and resilient world, such as NGOs, research institutes, or green startups.
- To collaborate with multidisciplinary teams of experts, such as scientists, engineers, designers, and policymakers, to tackle complex and challenging problems using data science.
- To communicate and disseminate my findings and recommendations to various audiences, such as stakeholders, clients, or the general public, using effective and engaging data storytelling techniques.
- To keep learning and growing as a data scientist by staying updated with the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in the field.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed reading my blog post and learned more about me and my journey to data science. I am very excited and optimistic about this career change and I look forward to the opportunities and challenges that await me.
