Title: "Embarking on a Data Science Journey: From Coursera to Kaggle with Vertex AI"

Blog Post:

As a budding data scientist fresh from completing Coursera's machine and deep learning courses, I embarked on a hands-on journey to deepen my understanding of data science using Vertex AI on Kaggle. My series of notebooks is a testament to my enthusiasm for learning and applying new data science concepts.

Setting the Stage with Vertex AI: I started by setting up the environment in Kaggle for Vertex AI, navigating through project creation and API setups. This foundational step was crucial for my subsequent experiments.

Exploring the Power of Text Embeddings: Next, I delved into generating text embeddings using Vertex AI. This process, involving data preparation and API interactions, was a fascinating dive into understanding how machines interpret text.

Visualizing the Unseen: The journey continued with visualizing these text embeddings. Reducing their dimensionality to visualize in 2D/3D was like watching a universe of text data unfold before my eyes, offering insights into text relationships.

Building a Semantic Q&A System: The final challenge was constructing a question-answer system using semantic search. This application of text embeddings showcased how far we can go in making machines comprehend and respond to human language nuances.

Through these notebooks, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also experienced the joy of discovery and creation in the data science world. It's just the beginning of a long, exciting road ahead!

Title: "My Data Science Adventure: Enhancing Knowledge with Vertex AI and Kaggle"

Hello fellow data enthusiasts! As a beginner in data science, I've taken my learning beyond Coursera courses to a fascinating project using Vertex AI on Kaggle. I'm excited to share more about this adventure and the insightful observations I've gathered.

Setting the Stage: My journey began with setting up the Vertex AI environment in Kaggle, a foundational step that paved the way for exciting experiments.

Diving into Text Embeddings: I then explored generating text embeddings using Vertex AI. This deep dive into text data handling and interactions with Vertex AI APIs was an eye-opening experience.

Visualizing Data: The visualization of text embeddings in 2D and 3D was a pivotal moment, revealing the intricate relationships between different text inputs.

Creating a Q&A System: The climax of my project was building a question-answer system using semantic search with text embeddings. This system aimed to understand and answer questions based on text meanings rather than just keywords.

Project Insights and Dataset Creation:

I used questions and answers from the Gardening and Landscaping Stack Exchange to generate question embeddings.
Observations from my Q&A system revealed that while the current prompt doesn't always generate the best answer, using the text-bison@002 text generation model without context can yield better responses.
Semantic search did not always pinpoint the most relevant questions from the Stack Exchange data.
I hypothesized that removing stop words might improve text embedding generation, as searching for keywords like "leaves Meyer Lemon tree yellow" on Stack Exchange offered more contextually rich questions.
Public Dataset Contribution:
In the spirit of collaborative learning, I've created and shared a public dataset on Kaggle with these embeddings. This dataset can serve as a valuable resource for others interested in text embeddings and semantic search applications.

This journey has not only been about learning and applying new data science concepts but also about understanding the nuances of real-world data and its challenges. It's a journey of continuous learning and growth, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next!
