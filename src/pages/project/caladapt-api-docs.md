## Background

[Cal-Adapt](https://cal-adapt.org/) provides peer-reviewed climate data and climate tools for California. The [Cal-Adapt API](https://api.cal-adapt.org/api/) provides programmatic access to climate data hosted on Cal-Adapt. It is built using Django, Django REST framework, and Django-Spillway, an open source library developed at the GIF.

## My Work

I set up the documentation stack for the Cal-Adapt API using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), a popular documentation generator for Python projects, using a theme from [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org). I wrote [tutorials and code samples](https://berkeley-gif.github.io/caladapt-docs/cookbook.html) to help users interested in working with the Cal-Adapt API.
