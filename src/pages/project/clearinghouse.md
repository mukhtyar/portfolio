## Background

The State Adaptation Clearinghouse is a centralized source of information and resources to assist California decision makers at the state, regional, and local levels for planning and implementing climate adaptation projects.

## My Work

From our initial discussions and brainstorming sessions, the main overall direction that emerged was to create a user experience that enabled users to explore the Clearinghouse resources in multiple ways. I looked at other clearinghouse websites for best practices and developed designs & web templates for the [Search Resources](https://resilientca.org/search/) and [Find Resources by Topic](https://resilientca.org/topics/) pages.

The current design is a result of improvements based on several rounds of user feedback and a desire from the client to bring the look and feel closer to other state websites.

I designed and developed an interactive web version of the [Adaptation Planning Guide](https://resilientca.org/apg/). The print version of the guide is over 200 pages with multiple chapters, appendices and figures. It's much harder to read such long content on the web. I created mock-ups in [Figma](https://www.figma.com), creating tabs corresponding to the logical divisions present in the report to chunk up the content, and summarized long paragraphs within each section into lists and accordions.
