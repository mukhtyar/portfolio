## Context & Problem

Climate adaptation efforts in California rely on a wide range of tools, guidance documents, funding programs, and planning frameworks produced across agencies and organizations. For state, regional, and local decision-makers, these resources were difficult to discover, compare, and apply in practice. Information was fragmented, buried in long reports, or scattered across disconnected websites — creating friction for practitioners who needed actionable guidance under real-world constraints like limited time, staff capacity, and regulatory complexity.

A central challenge was not a lack of content, but making authoritative adaptation knowledge usable for planning and implementation decisions

## What the Product Is

The [Adaptation Clearinghouse](https://resilientca.org/) is a public, web-based platform that curates and organizes climate adaptation resources to support planning and implementation across California. It enables users to discover tools, guidance, and case studies through multiple exploration paths — including search, topic-based browsing, and planning phases — rather than forcing a single linear workflow.

A core component of the product is the interactive, web-based Adaptation Planning Guide, which translates a lengthy, policy-heavy print document into a navigable, task-oriented experience designed for use during real planning workflows.

## My Role

As the designer and developer working closely with the [Governor’s Office of Planning and Research](https://www.lci.ca.gov/), I:

- Led product and UX strategy to define how diverse users could explore and apply adaptation resources, based on early discovery discussions and review of comparable clearinghouse models.

- Designed and developed multiple discovery pathways, including keyword search and topic-based navigation, to accommodate different user mental models and entry points.

- Iterated on the interface through multiple rounds of stakeholder feedback, balancing usability improvements with alignment to California state web standards and institutional design expectations.

- Re-imagined the 200+ page [Adaptation Planning Guide](https://resilientca.org/apg/) as an interactive web product, restructuring dense content into scannable sections using tabs, accordions, and summaries to support real-world planning use.

## Impact & Outcomes

<div class="outcomes-grid">

**Improved Discovery**
Enabled planners and practitioners to quickly find relevant adaptation tools and guidance without prior knowledge of specific agencies or reports.

**Usable Planning Guidance**
Transformed a static, print-oriented planning guide into a practical, web-based decision aid that could be used during active adaptation planning processes.

**Public-Sector Alignment**
Delivered a modernized experience that met accessibility and state design standards while significantly improving usability.

**Product Insight**
Reinforced the importance of treating policy content as a product - requiring user research, information architecture, and iteration - rather than as information to simply publish.
