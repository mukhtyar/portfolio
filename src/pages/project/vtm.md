## Background

The Wieslander Vegetation Type Mapping website showcases vegetation maps, photographs and plot locations from a series of surveys from the 1920s and 1930s carried out by Albert Everett Wieslander and others. These data represent a snapshot of California's vegetation in the early 20th century, and are a valuable resource for comparative and conservation ecology.

## My Work

I designed and built this website using [AngularJS 1.2](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). It was my first experience using a JavaScript framework, and I fell in love with the two-way data binding ü§© till I wanted to plot hundreds of plot and photo locations on a map! With the breaking changes in [Angular 2](https://angularjs.org/), I stayed away from all the cool JavaScript frameworks till I came across [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## Credits

Co-developed with the team at the [Geospatial Innovation Facility, UC Berkeley](http://gif.berkeley.edu/), using the [Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine](https://holos.berkeley.edu/).
